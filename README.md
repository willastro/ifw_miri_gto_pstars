  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/willastro/ifw_miri_gto_pstars/HEAD)

We present here a series of tutorials focused on ice data analysis. It contains the scripts to perform very initial stages of the spectral analysis, such as the continuum SED determination/removal and the silicate subtraction. Additionally, it introduces the user to two fitting tools called OMNIFIT and ENIIGMA.
